1)  Input to the program is a file named "inp-params.txt,".
    The processes details in the file named inp-params.txt should be given in the format as follows:

    n (number of Processes)
    n lines follow where ith line is :
    pid[i] t[i] p[i] k[i] (pid of process, processing time of process, period of process, frequency (no of times) of process)
    
    Example:
    2
    1 25 50 3
    2 35 100 4

2)
    a) Compile the RMS file by executing following command:
    g++ -std=c++11 Assgn1-RMSCS17BTECH11001.cpp -o rms

    b) Compile the EDF file by executing following commands:
    g++ -std=c++11 Assgn1-EDFCS17BTECH11001.cpp -o edf


3) 
    a) Run the RMS executable by :
    ./rms

    b) Run the EDF executable by :
    ./edf

4) Logs of RMS are generated in file name "RM-Log.txt".
   Logs of EDF are generated in file name "EDF-Log.txt".

5) Number of processes that came into system, Number of processes that successfully complete, Number of processes that missed their deadlines, Average
   waiting time stats are present in files named "RM-Stats.txt" and "EDF-Stats.txt" for rms and edf respectively.
